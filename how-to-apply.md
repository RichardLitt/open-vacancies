# How to Apply

- We welcome applications from anywhere in the world, regardless of your location and background
- We'd love to learn what you've built previously to understand what we could do together. The best is to show it, but if you can't, guide us through it in writing.
- Don't worry if you don't tick all the boxes. If there's something you'd like to work on at Haja or on OrbitDB, but you feel unsure about whether or not you meet the expectations, we'd still like to hear from you. Send us an application and tell us who you are, what you've built so far and what you'd like to work on!
- Reach out with an application along with additional materials at jobs@haja.io
